# Simple Medical Diagnosis System
I have created this project under Edunet Foundation. It is a Simple Medical Diagnosis System which can predict the following diseases:
* Alzheimers
* Heart Disease
* Parkinson's Disease
## How does it work ?
In the Models folder there are separate models which are trained for a particular disease. I have used different datasets for training the model which are present in the Datasets folder.
Now, for the training part I've uploaded the Notebook files which contains how I cleaned the datasets, explored the relations in the data itself and how I trained the models using SVM (Support Vector Machine).

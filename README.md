# Simple Medical Diagnosis System
I have created this project under Edunet Foundation. It is a Simple Medical Diagnosis System which can predict the following diseases:
* Alzheimers
* Heart Disease
* Parkinson's Disease
## How does it work ?
In the Models folder there are separate models which are trained for a particular disease. I have used different datasets for training the model which are present in the Datasets folder.
Now, for the training part I've uploaded the Notebook files which contains how I cleaned the datasets, explored the relations in the data itself and how I trained the models using the SVM (Support Vector Machine) algorithm.

## What all things you require to run this ?
Firstly, You need to have Python installed in your system after that using pip install these python libraries: 
* Jupyter notebook (If you want to see and edit the code)
* streamlit
* streamlit_option_menu
* pickle

### How to run it ?
After installing all the necessary libraries listed above type the following command in your Command Prompt or Terminal. 
```
streamlit run app.py
```
Now, the web application will be opened in your default web browser. 

#### Thank you ! Hope you liked it.
